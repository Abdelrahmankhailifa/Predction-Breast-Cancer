# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer diagnoses using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains features extracted from digitized images of breast mass biopsies, which are then used to predict whether the mass is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
